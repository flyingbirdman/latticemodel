## Lattice model with spin-orbit coupling
The initial goal of this project is to develop a library to simplify the numerical calculation of the lattice mode with spin-orbit coupling, given the configuration of lasers in the optical-lattice experiment.

#### What's include:
1. band structure in momentum space (along a loop and in an area)
2. FFT of band structure
3. Density of State (1D, 2D, 3D)

#### What can it be done and not included?
1. output the wavefunction -> calculate the maximum wannier funciton
